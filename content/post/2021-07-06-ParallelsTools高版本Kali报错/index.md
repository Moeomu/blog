## First update the kali source

- Ali cloud source is as follows

```sourcelist
deb http://mirrors.aliyun.com/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
deb-src http://mirrors.aliyun.com/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib
```

## Error report content

```shell
An error occurred while installing the following packages:
- libelf-dev
- linux-headers-5.10.0-kali9-amd64
- dkms

Install these packages manually and start the Parallels Tools installation again.
```

## Solution

- Install the missing package

```shell
sudo apt install dkms
sudo apt intall libelf-dev
```

> Pitfall record.  
> Kali 2021's default `xfce` desktop environment will cause a white screen after installing ParallelsTools, so switch the desktop environment to `gnome` in advance or deselect `xface` and select `gnome` when installing kali
