## VSCode-Python-Venv-PowerShell unsigned environment can't be activated

> I've been looking for a solution for a while, but the solution is to change the Windows security policy to a signed one, as follows

- `set-executionpolicy remotesigned`

> I found that this is a 2018 problem and there is no good solution, but I still found a good policy that changes the current user's signature policy to require remote signing, while other users are still blocked

- `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

> You can then view the policy changes with the following code

- `Get-ExecutionPolicy -LIST`

## Python change PIP source

> It's too much trouble to search for the source every time, so why not just take a note and back it up locally?

### Windows

`%HOMEPATH%/pip/pip.ini`

### Linux & macOS

`~/.pip/pip.conf`
