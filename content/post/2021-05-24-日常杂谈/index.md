## Mention

A little mention, Shanxi school enterprise pass the automatic clocking project after thinking about it will it decided to open source it, this is just a rush out of immature code, so there may be some reading difficulties, but the use will not have problems, but also has been stable operation for more than half a year, Readme I wrote all the use of methods and notes, the following is the open source address

[[Github]-XQT-Auto-Clockin](https://github.com/Misakaou/XQT-Clockin)

- Features
  - Automatic clocking
  - multi-user automatic clocking (to prevent the server is blocked IP set a delay clocking)
  - No account password required, only ID number is needed

## My Way

Seems to fall into depression more often, seems to be more and more difficult to control themselves, maybe should go to the hospital
